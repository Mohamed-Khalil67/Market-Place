# System Design Documentation - Flask Marketplace

## 1. System Overview

The Flask Marketplace is a web-based e-commerce platform that allows users to browse products, create accounts, add items to their shopping cart, and complete purchases. The system is designed with a focus on security, performance, and maintainability.

## 2. System Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

- User authentication (registration, login, logout)
- Product browsing and searching
- Product categorization
- Shopping cart functionality
- Order processing and payment integration
- User profile management

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Fast page loading and response times
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increasing numbers of users and products
- **Maintainability**: Well-organized code structure for easy updates
- **Usability**: Intuitive user interface and experience

## 3. System Architecture

The Flask Marketplace follows a modular architecture based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, implemented through Flask's blueprint system.

### 3.1 Architectural Patterns

- **MVC Pattern**: Separation of data (models), user interface (templates), and control logic (routes)
- **Blueprint Pattern**: Modular organization of application components
- **Factory Pattern**: Application creation through a factory function

### 3.2 Component Overview

- **Models**: Database entities representing users, products, categories, cart items, and orders
- **Views**: Jinja2 templates for rendering HTML pages
- **Controllers**: Route handlers for processing requests and responses
- **Extensions**: Flask extensions for additional functionality (SQLAlchemy, Login, etc.)

## 4. Database Design

### 4.1 Entity Relationship Diagram

The database consists of the following main entities:
- User
- Category
- Item (Product)
- CartItem
- Order
- OrderItem

### 4.2 Key Relationships

- A User can have many Items (products they own)
- A User can have many CartItems
- A User can have many Orders
- A Category can have many Items
- An Order can have many OrderItems
- An Item can be in many CartItems and OrderItems

## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1 Authentication and Authorization

- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Session-based authentication with Flask-Login
- Role-based access control for administrative functions

### 5.2 Data Protection

- CSRF protection on all forms
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure cookie settings
- Content Security Policy implementation

## 6. Performance Optimization

### 6.1 Caching Strategy

- Simple cache implementation for frequently accessed data
- Cache timeout configuration for data freshness

### 6.2 Database Optimization

- Indexing on frequently queried fields
- Relationship lazy loading configuration
- Query optimization

## 7. Deployment Considerations

### 7.1 Environment Configuration

- Development, testing, and production environment settings
- Environment variable management
- Secret key and sensitive data handling

### 7.2 Scaling Strategy

- Database connection pooling
- Static file serving optimization
- Potential for containerization
